The theme is used at [hoccer.com](http://hoccer.com/ "hoccer.com").  
The developing environment is [blogtest.hoccer.com](http://blogtest.hoccer-project.com/ "blogtest.hoccer.com").

The content of the front-page is hardcoded in ``front-page.php``.  
The translation of hardcoded text is done with [CodeStyling Localization](http://wordpress.org/plugins/codestyling-localization/ "CodeStyling Localization").  
The contact form in faq is done with [Contact Form 7](http://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/ "Contact Form 7").

For pages which are used by the app itself a custom template exsists. It is the ``xo.php`` file.
For a redirect to the appstore or playstore there is a custom template called ``download.php``. If it is in use you can fill out three custom fields. At first "appstore" with the appstore url. Secondly "playstore" with the playstore utl. At last "default" for all other devices. If nothing is set the default is your home url.
